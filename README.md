## 1. Project Topic and Goal

### 1.1 Project Topic
This project focuses on the detection of fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised machine learning. The primary task is binary classification, where the goal is to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The type of learning is supervised learning, as we will be training our models on a dataset containing labeled examples of both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

### 1.2 Project Goal
The main goal of this project is to build, evaluate, and compare several supervised learning models to determine which is most effective at identifying fraudulent transactions. A key challenge in this domain is the highly imbalanced nature of the data, where fraudulent transactions are a very small minority. Therefore, a secondary goal is to demonstrate robust evaluation techniques that go beyond simple accuracy, focusing on metrics like Precision, Recall, and the AUC-ROC score, which are more appropriate for imbalanced datasets. The ultimate objective is to select a model that provides the best balance between correctly identifying fraud and minimizing false positives.

### 1.3 Data Source
The dataset used for this project is the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset, available on Kaggle. It contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.
